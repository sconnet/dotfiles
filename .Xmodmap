! NOTE: this isn't a good solution because it doesn't work for all apps on
! modern X systems
! Use desktop manager settings instead
! Main Menu -> Preferences -> Keyboard: Layouts Tab -> Options: Caps Lock
! behavior: Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl
! or Ctrl position: Caps Lock sa Ctrl

!
! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_R
! TODO figure out, doesn't quite work - caps lock is acting like Ctrl-F
!
!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
!remove Control = Control_R
!keysym Control_R = Caps_Lock
!keysym Caps_Lock = Control_R
!add Lock = Caps_Lock
!add Control = Control_L

!
! Swap scrolling to be like MacOS (called Natural Scrolling)
!
!pointer = 1 2 3 5 4 7 6 8 9 10 11 12
